[06/04 08:24:30     81s] The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
[06/04 08:24:30     81s] A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
[06/04 08:24:30     81s] Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

[06/04 08:59:02    911s]     
[06/04 08:59:02    911s]     The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
[06/04 08:59:02    911s]     A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
[06/04 08:59:02    911s]     Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
